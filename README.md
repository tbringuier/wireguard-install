**This project is a bash script that aims to set up [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) on a Linux server, as easily as possible.**

WireGuard is a point-to-point VPN that can be used in different ways. Here, we mean a VPN as in: the client will forward all its traffic through an encrypted tunnel to the server.
The server will apply NAT to the client's traffic so it will appear as if the client is browsing the web with the server's IP.

The installer supports classic VPN clients and public-routing clients from the same script.
It can generate private, public, and mixed clients depending on the selected server mode.

The script supports both IPv4 and IPv6. Please check the [issues](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install/issues) for ongoing development, bugs and planned features! You might also want to check the [discussions](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install/discussions) for help.

WireGuard does not fit your environment? Check out [openvpn-install](https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install).

## Requirements

Supported distributions:

- AlmaLinux >= 8
- Alpine Linux
- Arch Linux
- CentOS Stream >= 8
- Debian >= 10
- Fedora >= 32
- Flatcar Linux
- Oracle Linux
- Rocky Linux >= 8
- Ubuntu >= 18.04

## Usage

Download and execute the script. Answer the questions asked by the script and it will take care of the rest.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angristan/wireguard-install/master/wireguard-install.sh
chmod +x wireguard-install.sh
./wireguard-install.sh
```

It will set up WireGuard on the server, configure it and create a client configuration file.
On distributions that require it, the script also installs the needed WireGuard packages and enables the WireGuard startup service.
Public-routing mode requires `iptables/ip6tables` and does not support active `firewalld`.

Run the script again to add or remove clients!

## Providers

I recommend these cheap cloud providers for your VPN server:

Please open an issue before submitting a PR if you want to discuss a change, especially if it's a big one.

### Code formatting

We use [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) and [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) to enforce bash styling guidelines and good practices. They are executed for each commit / PR with GitHub Actions, so you can check the configuration [here](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install/blob/master/.github/workflows/lint.yml).
